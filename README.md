# Detection as Code Platform

> **Automated Adversary Emulation, Sigma Rule Generation, & One-Click SIEM Deployment**

This project provides an **end-to-end** “Detection as Code” approach, surpassing existing solutions by **automating adversary emulation** (aligned with [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)), **generating Sigma rules**, checking for duplicates, and **deploying them to various SIEMs** through a robust **CI/CD pipeline** and intuitive **dashboard**.

## Overview
**Detection as Code Platform** is designed to help security teams:
- **Continuously test** their defenses using adversary emulation.
- **Automate** the generation of detection rules (Sigma).
- **Deploy** detection rules to SIEM platforms (Elastic, Splunk, etc.) with **minimal manual effort**.
- Easily **integrate** with CI/CD processes for real-time updates and no-hassle deployments.

---

## Features
- **Adversary Emulation (MITRE ATT&CK)**
  - One-click scenario generation.
  - Scheduling and randomization of testing.

- **Sigma Rule Generation**
  - Automated creation post-emulation.
  - Duplicate checks to avoid overlapping or redundant detections.

- **SIEM Integration**
  - One-click deployment to popular SIEMs (Elastic, Splunk).
  - Real-time monitoring of deployment status and logs.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - Automates the testing, rule generation, and deployment cycle.
  - Detailed logs and error handling.

- **Dashboard & Management Interface**
  - Real-time overview of adversary emulations.
  - Organized rule library, with quick actions to deploy or manage rules.
  - Role-based access and audit logging for compliance.

## Technologies
- **Vite** – Fast bundler and dev server.
- **TypeScript** – Type-safe development experience.
- **React** – Frontend library for building modular user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI design.
- **shadcn-ui** – A set of customizable React components built on Tailwind CSS (if included).
- **Node.js / Express / Python / .NET** – (Pick one or more, depending on your backend choice).
- **Sigma** – Detection rule specification.
- **CI/CD Tools** – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins (configurable per project needs).

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/detection-as-code.git
   cd detection-as-code
Backend Setup

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/detection-as-code.git
   cd detection-as-code
Backend Setup

If using Node.js:

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
If using Python:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
(Adjust commands as necessary for your environment.)

Frontend Setup

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The development server typically runs at http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port is specified).

Environment Configuration

Copy .env.example to .env (in both backend and frontend if needed).

Fill in the details for SIEM integrations, database connections, and other secrets.

(Optional) Docker

If provided, run:

docker-compose up --build
This sets up the entire stack in containers.

Usage
Access the Dashboard

Once both the frontend and backend are running, open your browser at the displayed local URL.

Adversary Emulation

Initiate or schedule emulations from the dashboard.

Monitor logs and results in real time.

Sigma Rule Generation & Deployment

Check newly created rules in the “Detections” or similar section.

Deploy them to your configured SIEM with a single click.

CI/CD Pipeline

Configure automated triggers for your pipeline.

All merges or scheduled intervals can automatically run emulations and deploy rules.
