# Detection as Code Platform

> **Automated Adversary Emulation, Sigma Rule Generation, & One-Click SIEM Deployment**

This project provides an **end-to-end** “Detection as Code” approach, surpassing existing solutions by **automating adversary emulation** (aligned with [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)), **generating Sigma rules**, checking for duplicates, and **deploying them to various SIEMs** through a robust **CI/CD pipeline** and an intuitive **dashboard**.

## Overview
**Detection as Code Platform** is designed to help security teams:
- **Continuously test** their defenses with adversary emulations.
- **Automate** the generation of detection rules (Sigma).
- **Deploy** those detection rules to SIEM platforms (Elastic, Splunk, etc.) with **minimal manual effort**.
- Easily **integrate** with CI/CD processes for real-time updates and no-hassle deployments.

---

## Features
- **Adversary Emulation (MITRE ATT&CK)**  
  - One-click scenario generation.  
  - Scheduling and randomization for continuous testing.

- **Sigma Rule Generation**  
  - Automated creation of rules post-emulation.  
  - Duplicate checks to avoid overlapping or redundant detections.

- **SIEM Integration**  
  - One-click deployment to popular SIEMs (Elastic, Splunk).  
  - Real-time monitoring of deployment status and logs.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  - Automates testing, rule generation, and deployment.  
  - Provides logs and error handling for visibility.

- **Dashboard & Management Interface**  
  - Real-time overview of adversary emulations and rule generation.  
  - Organized rule library with quick actions to deploy or manage rules.  
  - Role-based access control and audit logging.

## Technologies
- **Vite** – A fast and opinionated build tool with dev server support.  
- **TypeScript** – Strong typing for safer and more reliable code.  
- **React** – A powerful library for building component-based UIs.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.  
- **shadcn-ui** (if included) – A set of customizable React components built on Tailwind CSS.  
- **Node.js / Python / .NET** – Depending on backend choice.  
- **Sigma** – Detection rule format.  
- **CI/CD Tools** – GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar.

- **backend/** – Contains core functionality for emulations, rule generation, and SIEM integrations.  
- **frontend/** – Houses the React application (or chosen framework) for the user interface.  
- **tests/** – Contains unit/integration tests for both backend and frontend code.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/detection-as-code.git
   cd detection-as-code
2. **Backend Setup**

**If using Node.js:**

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

**If using Python:**

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
*(Adjust commands as necessary for your environment.)*

**Frontend Setup**

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
By default, the frontend will run at http://localhost:3000 (or as configured).

4. **Environment Configuration**

Copy .env.example to .env (in both backend and frontend if needed).

Fill in details for SIEM integrations, database connections, and other secrets.

5. **(Optional) Docker**

If provided, you can run the entire stack with:

docker-compose up --build
This will spin up containers for both the backend and frontend.

**Usage**
Access the Dashboard

Open your browser to the local URL where the frontend is served (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Adversary Emulation

Initiate or schedule emulations through the dashboard.

Monitor logs and results in real time.

Sigma Rule Generation & Deployment

Automatically generate Sigma rules when an emulation completes.

View new rules in the "Detections" section and deploy them to your configured SIEM with a single click.

CI/CD Pipeline

Configure automated triggers for your pipeline (e.g., merges to main, scheduled intervals).

Upon execution, the pipeline runs emulations, generates rules, checks for duplicates, and deploys them automatically.

**Contributing**
We welcome contributions from the community. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.

2. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages.

3. Open a Pull Request to the main branch, describing what you’ve changed and why.
